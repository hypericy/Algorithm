# Searching
1. Linear Search

2. Binary Search

3.BFS

    Pros:
      finding shortest path
      finding closer nodes
    Cons:
      More Memory

4.DFS

    Pros:
      less Memory   
      Does the path exit?  
    Cons:    
      can be slow
      
      
When to use BFS or DFS?
- If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:    BFS
- If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:    BFS
- If the tree is very wide:    DFS
- If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:   DFS
- Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:   DFS
- Finding the shortest path:      BFS
